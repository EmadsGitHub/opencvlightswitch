# opencvlightswitch
This project is for me to to automate my room's lights simply by sitting down at my desk.
The automatic light switch is powered by OpenCV and Arduino/STM32.

Basically, arduinos can communicate with python scripts through simply passing infromation into a designated COM port. Therefore, we can automatically communicate to it to perform functions using a library like OpenCV.

A camera detects my face, and turns on a light. If I leave for a while, it turns back off.

Attached is the full code to see.
